# 🧰 Python Tools

A personal collection of ready-to-use, standalone Python scripts designed for practical use in professional or temporary environments - without relying on personal accounts, private resources, or external infrastructure.

## 📁 Purpose

This repository serves as a lightweight toolkit of Python utilities that can be used:

- On any clean machine (e.g. remote job, emergency setup)
- Without access to your development environment
- Without dependency on cloud or private services

Ideal for:
- Working on shared workstations
- Debugging or quick tasks
- Reusable logic in day-to-day scripting

## 📦 Structure

<pre>
Python_tools/
└── files_and_folders/
    └── dictionary_structure.py
</pre>


## ✅ Usage

Each script is self-contained and can be copied for development purposes or run as-is.No third-party dependencies unless explicitly stated in the script header.

This toolkit can also serve as a base for developing new app features — particularly to automate or optimize repetitive and time-consuming tasks in software projects.
